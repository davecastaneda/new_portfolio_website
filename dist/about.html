                <p>
                    After studying audio engineering at Columbia College, I became an intern at a post-production house,
                    and later, I went on to manage a recording studio. Within the next few years, though, the music
                    industry took a severe downturn. Around that time, I decided to leave my job at the studio, and
                    began to search for my next passion.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Taking a friend's advice, I started learning how to code. In no time, I fell in love with it, and
                    have been learing how to improve as a developer ever since. Thankfully, the same skill set that I
                    had began cultivating as a studio manager/recording engineer (troubleshooting difficult problems by
                    paying close attention to the details, thoroughly documenting pertinent information, thinking things
                    through creatively, and working with a team toward a common goal) came in handy.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In addition to programming, I love vintage gaming, mechanical keyboards, film, synthesizers, and
                    most of all, my two dogs.

                    As part of the Internal Services Department, my contributions were vital to the success of Passage

                    complete work items, and updating existing code.
