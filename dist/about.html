                <p>
                    After studying audio engineering in college, I interned at a post-production house, and later,
                    managed a recording studio. When the music industry took a downturn, I left to search for
                    my next passion. I fell in love with coding soon after.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've found that the skills I
                    cultivated as a studio manager/recording engineer (learning how to
                    troubleshoot problems, writing thorough documentation, asking substantive questions, using
                    creativity
                    to overcome roadblocks, and
                    working with others to accomplish a common goal) have served me well as a developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to programming, I enjoy playing vintage games, synthesizers, mechanical keyboards, and
                    spending time with my two dogs.

                    As part of the Internal Services Department, my contributions were vital to the success of Passage
                    Technology's other teams. I was responsible for creating new applications, fixing bugs, documenting
                    technical issues, gathering requirements from stakeholders, and collaborated with other departments
                    to
                    complete work items, make quality of life improvements, and update existing code.

                    Stylebot, Optimizely, and Visual Studio to write, debug, A/B test, and update code (HTML, CSS,
